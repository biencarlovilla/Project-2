# Future Endeavors
It is without a doubt that this pandemic affected all of our future plans that we looked forward to. Most of us have spent the last 7 months working and going to school from home. The present may feel repetitive and boring and it’s hard to be excited about the future when there is so much uncertainty during this time. We know it isn’t safe to return to our normal lives but as things are still uncertain, people want to start making exciting fun plans again!

So we wanted to create an app that allows you to share your plans and activities with your friends so everyone can start planning their future endeavors when all this mayhem is over.

Our app allows users to create a bucket list of exciting activities and events you have planned for the future. Users can add group to-do’s on their bucket list, as well as see the date and description of the activities.
